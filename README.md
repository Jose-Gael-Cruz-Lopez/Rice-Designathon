## Overview

EchoBox is a voice-first memory application designed to preserve meaningful human moments through audio. The platform enables users to record, store, and share authentic voice messages—turning photos into emotionally rich, lasting memories.

This project was built for **Rice Design-a-thon 2026** and focuses on human-centered design, cross-generational usability, and privacy-first interaction.

---

## Problem

Modern communication tools prioritize speed and convenience, but sacrifice emotional depth.

Through user research, we identified several gaps:
- Text-based communication strips away tone, emotion, and presence
- Voice messages are valued but underused due to friction and discomfort
- Many users save voicemails but lack tools to organize or revisit them intentionally

EchoBox addresses these gaps by reframing voice as something worth preserving, not just sending.

---

## Solution

EchoBox provides a lightweight, intuitive interface for capturing and revisiting voice-based memories.

Core capabilities include:
- One-tap voice recording with minimal cognitive overhead
- Private memory archives (“Memory Boxes”) for storing meaningful audio
- Invite-only sharing to maintain trust and emotional safety
- Visual feedback to make recording feel natural and approachable
- Photo and voice pairing to create context-rich memories

---

## Research & Validation

Design decisions were informed by surveys and interviews across multiple generations (ages 8–75).

Key findings:
- 87% of participants felt hearing a loved one’s voice is more personal than reading text
- 78% reported missing emotional nuance in digital communication
- Less than one-third regularly send voice messages, despite valuing them
- 64% had saved voicemails with no structured way to revisit them

These insights confirmed a strong unmet need for intentional voice preservation.

---

## Design Decisions

- **Ease of use:** Recording must be as simple as sending a text to drive adoption  
- **Privacy by default:** All saved memories are private unless intentionally shared  
- **Low-pressure interaction:** Soft animations and minimal prompts reduce anxiety  
- **Emotion-first UX:** Designed for presence and meaning rather than efficiency  

---

## Use of AI

AI was used strictly as a research synthesis tool to:
- Summarize anonymous qualitative interview data
- Identify recurring emotional and behavioral patterns
- Accelerate insight discovery under hackathon time constraints

All interpretation, design choices, and product direction were human-led.
