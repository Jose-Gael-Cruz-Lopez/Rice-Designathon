## Overview

We don’t always realize it, but the voices of the people we love are often the first thing we forget.

EchoBox is a voice-first mobile application designed to help people reconnect and preserve meaningful relationships through sound. Instead of relying on impersonal text messages or scripted AI assistants, EchoBox encourages users to record and share genuine voice messages with close friends and family.

By allowing people to capture thoughts, stories, and greetings in their own voice, EchoBox creates an audio scrapbook of meaningful moments. Through hearing tone, laughter, and emotion, users can feel a sense of presence and sincerity that text alone cannot provide.

EchoBox uses technology to amplify real human voices—so that when memory fades, what remains is the story.

---

## Problem

Modern communication tools prioritize speed and convenience, but often sacrifice emotional depth.

Through early observation and research, we identified several challenges:
- Text-based communication removes tone, emotion, and presence
- Voice messages are valued but underused due to habit, friction, or discomfort
- Many people save voicemails or audio clips but lack an organized, intentional way to preserve them
- Emotional connection becomes especially difficult to maintain across generations

EchoBox was created to address these gaps by treating voice not as disposable, but as something worth preserving.

## Research Process & Findings

Our research journey began with a shared observation: while texting dominates communication today, something deeply human often feels missing—especially across generations.

### Research Methods
- 6 in-depth, one-on-one interviews
- Participants across ages 8–75
- Qualitative emotional analysis combined with quantitative survey insights
- Supplemented with external research on voice communication and loneliness

### Key Quantitative Findings
- 87% agreed that hearing a loved one’s voice feels more personal than reading a text
- Less than one-third send voice messages at least once a week
- 78% reported missing the emotion behind voices in digital communication
- 64% had saved voicemails or voice notes but no organized way to revisit them

These findings revealed a clear opportunity: people value voice deeply, but existing tools do not support preserving it intentionally.

---

## Qualitative Insights & User Quotes

During interviews, participants shared strong emotional responses tied to voice and memory.

One interviewee stated:
> “I need to make more memories with my family… sometimes it feels like it’s not the same connection through messages.”

Another participant shared that they could no longer remember their father’s voice and now try to save any voicemails or short clips they receive, simply to hold on to that sound.

Across interviews, themes of loneliness, authenticity, and fear of forgetting emerged repeatedly. Many users expressed that voice felt more real, more comforting, and more human than text—but also admitted feeling shy or worried about intruding when sending voice messages.

This insight directly shaped EchoBox’s warm, low-pressure design.

---

## Supporting Research & Validation

Our findings aligned with existing research on vocal communication:
- Vocal interaction has been shown to alleviate stress and reinforce emotional bonds
- A recent survey of 1,000 Americans found that:
  - 2 out of 3 individuals use voice notes
  - Nearly 50% reported that voice messages strengthened relationships or reduced loneliness
  - 61% agreed that voice conveys tone and emotion more effectively than text

The convergence of user interviews and external research confirmed that EchoBox addresses a genuine, validated need.

---

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### One-Tap Voice Recording
Ease of use was critical. Multiple interviewees emphasized that if recording wasn’t as easy as texting, they wouldn’t use it.

EchoBox uses a single, prominent microphone button:
- Tap and hold to record
- Release to send
- No menus or extra steps

Light visual feedback, such as animated waveforms and soft prompts, was added to help users feel comfortable and less self-conscious while recording.

---

### Memory Boxes (Voice Archives)

Users frequently mentioned saving voicemails they never delete. To support this behavior intentionally, we introduced **Memory Boxes**—a private archive for meaningful voice recordings.

These archives:
- Allow users to bookmark and organize cherished voice messages
- Are private by default to encourage saving without social pressure
- Were inspired by the idea of a “treasure box” for voices

---

### Privacy & Trust

Because voice is personal and vulnerable, trust was a major concern in our research.

Design choices included:
- Invite-only, closed network (no public broadcasting)
- Mutual connections required to exchange messages
- Clear indicators when messages are played
- Ability to unsend or delete voice messages within a short timeframe

These decisions directly reflected user concerns about exposure and emotional safety.

---

## Use of AI in the Design Process

With interviews spanning ages 8–75, we gathered hours of qualitative data under tight hackathon constraints.

AI was used as a research synthesis tool to:
- Summarize anonymous interview responses
- Surface recurring emotional themes
- Highlight generational differences in how memory loss and connection were described

We used AI (Claude) to analyze open-ended responses, particularly the “additional thoughts” sections, which revealed subtle but consistent patterns—such as anxiety around losing voices.

All final insights, interpretations, and design decisions were human-led. AI served to accelerate synthesis, not replace empathy or judgment.

*When memory is erased, when there is nothing left to remember except the story, the voice remains.*
